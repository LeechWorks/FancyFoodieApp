A lot of young people love to take photo with their smart phone, making comments to it and sharing with their friend about what they had done. I personally find it would be useful if there is a tool for anyone to create food event and share with friends.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis project is a food review application called \"Fancy Foodie\" for iOS. The particular aim of the project is to be able to review food and sharing food event with friends. Before you start eating, the user would take a picture of the food they are going to eat and give some basic information about location, tags, date etc. Tags are used to describe the type of the food such as \"Chinese, Bun\" or \"Tea, Classic, Jasmine Green\". After finish eating, the user would make comments of the food. This application also lets user search nearby location or location defined by user, which will show a list of pins on the map where the user had been there before, to decide what the user want to eat. When the user saves a food event, he or she may also share the review and foodie's photo to Facebook or Twitter or to an email address. For user to see the history records, the application also provide a way to view statistics data such as how many places the user has been, how the rates are, how many tags the user used etc. ?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Changelog\r\n\r\n2013.4.23  -1.0 version released.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n\r\nXinjiang and others.
