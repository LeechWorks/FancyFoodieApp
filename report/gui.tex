\section{Home Tab} % (fold)
\label{sec:tabs}
	As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:hometab}, home tab is created for adding new event to the app. The default view for user when entering the app is the view shown in Figure~\ref{fig:guideview}. \\
	
	Figure~\ref{fig:guideview} gives a short tutorial for user. If the user chooses the plus sign in navigation bar, another blank view with black background should show up. After tapping on the camera icon in navigation bar, View in Figure~\ref{fig:pickaction} will display an action sheet including ``Use Last Photo Taken'', ``Take Photo'', ``Choose from Library'' and ``Cancel''. Here we use ``Take Photo'' as an example. For instance, we choose ``Take Photo'', the app should pop up a modal and let user take picture of food. A modal like Figure~\ref{fig:moveandscale} should appear for user to move and scale the photo to a right position and size after choosing a picture. Figure~\ref{fig:didpick} will show up after scaling step. If no photo is chosen, a warning will show up which alerts user to add a photo first. Tapping on next to move to next view as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:moreinfo}. In this view, a form is created for user to fill in location information, date, tags, comment and rate. Since the user just starts to eat, comment and 
rate field can be empty for now. Other fields should be filled correctly in this view because the user won't be able to edit all the other fields once saved the event. In Figure~\ref{fig:locationpicker}, the location list is generated through Foursquare Application Programming Interface(API). Foursquare API is chosen  because it has a good reputation in both academic and industry world for rich venues in their database. By passing current longitude and latitude, we're able to have a venue list based the distance.

\section{Food List Tab} % (fold)
\label{sec:foodie_list_tab}

   In food list tab, it fetches a list of food events ordered by creation date. Figure~\ref{fig:foodlist} shows some events. On each table cell, it shows a thumbnail, relative date and event location name. A green menu pop up button is created for sharing with social media(Figure~\ref{fig:foodlist-share}), updating comment(Figure~\ref{fig:foodlist-comment}) and changing rate(Figure~\ref{fig:foodlist-rate}). \\
   
   After choosing one event, a detail view of the event will appear as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:foodlist-detail} and Figure~\ref{fig:foodlist-detailcontd}. You could see all the detailed information here which stored in the local database. In the top navigation bar, a sharing button displays in order to let user publish the event conveniently. If the user chooses Twitter, it'll check if he is logged in Twitter or not. After making sure the user have a Twitter account, Figure~\ref{fig:foodlist-twitter} will appear. The comment and photo is generated by the app. Simply tapping on send, and the event will be shared. \\

\section{Statistics Tab} % (fold)
\label{sec:stats_tab}

Statistics tab is supposed to give the user an overview of all events he created. As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:stats}, ``Rates'' are clustered in different categories. All the tags are counted and shown in the table. The total number of places are shown in the table as well. In this way, the user could easily get an idea of what kind of places and food he likes.

\section{Map Tab} % (fold)
\label{sec:map_tab}

In Figure~\ref{fig:map}, all the event locations are labeled with red pins. By default, it is showing the events around your current location. But you could also change your view by passing address in Figure~\ref{fig:map-address}. After choosing a location in the list, the table view will be dismissed and the new central region will be the location you chose.

\section{Setting Tab} % (fold)
\label{sec:setting_tab}

Setting tab provides a view to setup configurations of the app (Figure~\ref{fig:settings}). The view in this tab is a static table view built in storyboard. A web-view controller is created to show the app website and author introduction. By turning on the \emph{save photo} option, it will save the photo to an album. The feedback option is used for user to submit feedback through TestFlight. TestFlight is a online tool to do open beta testing on the fly. By hooking with TestFlight, we will be able to see all the crash reports, time durations for each session, and even ask questions to users when a checkpoint is reached.\\
