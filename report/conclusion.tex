\chapter{Conclusion}

This project is successfully finished in time with good functionalities overall. It could provide users to take picture of food they like and create tags, location information, rates, and comments to the food. At the time, it provides convenient methods for users to share those food with their friend by social media such as Facebook, Twitter, Weibo etc.. A map view and statistics view are created for users to have better understanding of their preferences. \\

There are still more features could be done in future. Since Yelp is a good resource of restaurant information, the App could pull more information from Yelp in order to give users more about the place they eat at. A central database is needed to making users communicate with each other such as making comments to friends food inside of the app. Chinese is my mother tongue, so I'm hoping to adding multi-language feature for the App. In this way, more people could be able to use the App. Last but not least, a larger pool of testers should be included in beta testing process.
