Food review is becoming trendy among young people since smart phones are getting more and more popular. However, not many tools available for people to review a cuisine and publish their comment to social media conveniently in the market. This project is meant to develop an iOS App called \emph{Fancy Foodie} which could take picture of food, attach meta data such as location, rate, comment, date, tags to the picture and share with friends via social media including Facebook, Twitter, Weibo etc.. The App also provides ways to search events by address and review statistic of all events.
